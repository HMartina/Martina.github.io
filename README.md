Hands are mine,
    but the method is yours.
Brain is mine,
    but the guidance is yours.
Results are mine,
    but the faith is yours.
Studies become interesting when you teach.
Your guidance brings top grades in our reach.
we know we can 
    APPROACH you
even when you are busy,
    that you'll make a 
tough task.....quite easy!!!
We can never thank you enough anyway.
